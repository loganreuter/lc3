# LC3 VM 

A 16-bit virtual machine using the von Neumann architecture  
The machine is designed to understand LC3 assembly code  

The goal of this project is to learn about the process of   
implementing a virtual machine. I will then try to expand  
it to implement other opcodes and run using the Harvard  
architecture. My ultimate goal is to build a virtual machine   
capable of interpretting my own custom programming language.

The code for this project was acquired from these two articles:
